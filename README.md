# micro-promise
A small A+ compliant toy Promises implementation, do not use.

I wrote this to try and thoroughly understand the [Promises/A+ specification](https://promisesaplus.com/). Comments in the code refer to each specific clause in the specification, for example: 2.3.3.1 [[code]](https://github.com/danielmendel/micro-promise/blob/master/main.js#L31-L32) and [[spec]](https://promisesaplus.com/#point-54)

The specification is delightfully brief, precise, and includes an extremely comprehensive test suite — this is the yardstick against which I make the claim of compliance. Many many thanks and kudos to the contributors there.

If you're looking for a Promises library to *use* — then please see the [ES6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) polyfill, and then stop using it once ES6 compatibility is sufficient for your users.

to be entirely clear:

Other use not endorsed or supported — repeat **DO NOT USE**.
